Welcome to my portfolio! My name is Rebecca Bromley-Dulfano (she/her), and I'm a third year medical student at Stanford University.

Over the last three years, I've discovered growing passions for health policy, internal medicine, and the social determinants of health. I hope this website offers additional perspective on the work I've done and the interests that I have. 

Thanks,
Becca
