Welcome to my portfolio! My name is Rebecca Bromley-Dulfano (she/her), and I'm a third year medical student at Stanford University. I grew up in Salt Lake City, Utah (pictured below). I graduated in 2018 from Stanford University with a BS with Honors and MS in Biology. During my gap year, I worked in a public service fellowship at a Federally-Qualified Health Center in East Palo Alto, CA. I returned to Stanford for medical school and over the last three years, I've discovered growing passions for primary care, health policy research, and healthcare system reform. I aspire to become a physician-researcher and an advocate for a more equitable, sustainable, and economic healthcare system. 

I hope this website offers a glimpse of some of the work I've done and the interests that I have. If you'd like to connect, please reach out to me at rabd@stanford.edu.

Thanks,
Becca
